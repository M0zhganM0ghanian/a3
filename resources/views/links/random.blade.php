 <p>
  Do not use the same password, security question and answer for multiple important accounts.
  Do not use the names of your families, friends or pets in your passwords.
  Do not use postcodes, house numbers, phone numbers, birthdates, ID card numbers, social security numbers, and so on in your passwords.
  Do not use any dictionary word in your passwords.
  Do not use two or more similar passwords which most of their characters are same, for example, ilovefreshflowersMac, ilovefreshflowersDropBox, since if one of these passwords is stolen, then it means that all of these passwords are stolen.
